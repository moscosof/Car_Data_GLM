# Data Car - Logistic Regression 
Car Data Logistic Model

Logistic regression is a method for fitting a regression curve, y = f(x), when y is a categorical variable.
The typical use of this model is predicting y given a set of predictors x. The predictors can be continuous, categorical or 
a mix of both.
